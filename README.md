# Social Media Links
A webpage to replace my old, boring LinkTree page that links out to my other social media sites.

Now you can click on CUBES!

## Libraries:
React and Styled Components

## Artwork:
Blender 3D - Eevee rendering engine

## Why did you use React for this and not vanilla JS / some useful libraries??
Because I am very silly.

Also I wanted to challenge and test my knowledge of React and Hooks without getting too bogged down with other libraries.
