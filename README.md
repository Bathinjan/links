## About

### Libraries:
React and Styled Components

### Artwork:
Blender 3D - Eevee rendering engine

### Why did you use React for this and not vanilla JS / some useful libraries??
Because I am very silly.

Also I wanted to challenge and test my knowledge of React and Hooks without getting too bogged down with other libraries.
